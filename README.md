# LiptoSpeech
Lip reading using End to End Sentence Level Model

## Problem Statement:

Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speakerâ€™s mouth.
Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction

    Input : A Video file of a person speaking some word or phrase.
    Output : The predicted word or phrase the person was speaking.
